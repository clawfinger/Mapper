Arduino Ultrasonic scaner

This is my test application for ultrasonic area scanner for robotic platforms. 
Ultrasonic range measuring unit connected to Arduino and installed on servo is scanning surroundings
in a 170 degrees angle and feeding data to COM port. Application using QtGui visualising incoming data as an array of points 
representing obstacles on a path of robotic platform.
